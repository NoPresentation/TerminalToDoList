# TerminalToDoList
This is a terminal based application written with python for a to do list application.
I coded this recently as a practice project for learning python, I would say it's a pretty good project idea.

Why I created this project:
- To pracitce python
- To make a real world application that is fully functional and usable
- To apply database concepts on a real project

Functions of this project:
- CRUD applicatoins for the following entites: Users, User_Details, Tasks, Tags
- Connecting each user to their User_Details and tasks using user_id
- Connecting Tasks to Tags

Libraries used in this project:
- sqlite: for the database
- art: to get the function "text2art" to make the style terminal text
- termcolor: to color terminal text
- inquirer: to allow the user to choose options
- prettytable: to organize data in the terminal

Note: This is a beginner project, you will probably see many mistakes.
